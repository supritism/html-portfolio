<h1>About the author : Supriti</h1>
<p> Hi, I am Supriti , the author of this website. My aim while writing this blog is to reflect on my 
  thoughts and experiences and share them with a much wider audience. Your opinion and comments will
  be always valued. You can reach me at supriti.sm@gmail.com </p>

<p> In the long journey through lifeâ€¦we 
  meet many wonderful people, visit many incredible places and experience many memorable feelings.
  But as time passes, memories fade off and new ones take over. But at some point in time, we might 
  like to look back at our older life events -learn and laugh through them. And this is why I have 
  decided to write one.</p>

  <p> So, welcome to my blog all you Beautiful Souls!!!!</p>
